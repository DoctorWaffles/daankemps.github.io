Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Initially started as an artist and designer, however over the course of my study and free time I discovered that programming could add way more to that mixture. Nowadays I see myself as a creative developer or a technical artist. I like to be busy with creating games and prototypes, game design, procedural generation, networking and more cool stuff!

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:contact@daankemps.com) or download my resume in [Dutch](/assets/files/resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} or in [English](/assets/files/resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
