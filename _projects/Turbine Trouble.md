Turbine Trouble was an university project for the Oyfo museum in Hengelo as client. In this project, we were given eight weeks time of development with a team of five artists and two programmers. The assignment that was given to us was to create an educational VR game/experience about one renewable energy with young kids (age 10) as a target group. We chose to develop the game in Unity, since we were the most familiar with this engine. Our game is targeted to be played with an Oculus Rift VR.


<!-- In a VR world the players generally try to interact with everything possible to see what is going to happen in this virtual world. One of my tasks during this project was to implement sound so the player interact with as much stuff as possible in a natural way.


To really show the impact of the players actions underwater, we had the idea to clean up the underwater scene based on how much trash the player removed in their playthrough. Initially the water started out being digustingly green, polluted by tons of trash and lifeless. By cleaning up the scenery the water would gradually become cleaner, more blue and more vibrant, since there would also be flocks of fish and other sea creatures swimming around the player. Since this is an education game, we tried to put a lot of focus on this feedback to show the underwater pollution. -->
