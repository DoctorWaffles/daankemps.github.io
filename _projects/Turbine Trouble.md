Turbine Trouble was an university project for the Oyfo museum in Hengelo as client. In this project, we were given eight weeks time of development with a team of five artists and two programmers. The assignment that was given to us was to create an educational VR game/experience about one renewable energy with young kids (age 10) as a target group. We chose to develop the game in Unity, since we were the most familiar with this engine. Our game is targeted to be played with an Oculus Rift VR.
