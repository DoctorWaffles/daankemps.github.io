Overcharged is a local multiplayer game in which two players attempt to shoot the ball inside their opponent's hoop. Both players have a set of abilities. Such as dashing, deflecting and a jetpack for jumping, to make the gameplay a bit more interesting.

During the project I was mostly the bridge between the programmers and the artists. Next to that I worked on sounds (with the use of FMOD), modelling, UVing, texturing, some shader work and I transfered most artist content to git.
