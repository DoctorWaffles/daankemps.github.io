long_description: "Vipinthemix is a prison level made for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's Jailbreak gamemode. Vipinthemix was originally made by Dutchkiller, whom I collabarated together with to recreate a new version for Counter-Strike: Global Offensiv. Jailbreak is a round based gamemode that takes place in a prison between two teams, the prisoners and the guards. The guards must keep the order and prevent a rebellion, meanwhile the prisoners can either follow along or rebel. Each round a guard is chosen as the warden and gets to decide what fun activities the prison will be doing. If there is only one prisoner left alive who isnâ€™t rebelling they get to decide what happens next round."
