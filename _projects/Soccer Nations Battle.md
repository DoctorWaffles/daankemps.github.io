During my third year I was lucky enough to join [Virtual Play](https://virtualplay.games/)  in Utrecht as an intern. My main task was to fix bugs and add small additional features on their game Soccer Nations: Battle. I also worked on the input system of Soccer Nations: Battle, [Rewired](https://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/). Rewired replaces Unityâ€™s input system with a new system that completely redefines how you work with input, with features like menu ownership and handling reconnecting/disconnecting controllers.

Furthermore I worked on implement a new localisation system, as the initial localization system had its flaws, so we decided to use the [I2 Localization plugin](http://inter-illusion.com/tools/i2-localization/) from the Unity Asset store. I2 Localization provided an easy to use synchronization between an excel sheet (which we located at our Google Drive) for each language strings and keys.


Aside of programming I also worked on some UI/UX improvements. One of the main parts I worked on was improving the userflow from starting up the game, selecting a level and team selection. Previously the userflow had little detail about which level was selected and there were no additional options. The new stage selection gave the player a bit more freedom on how he would like to play his game. With the additional thumbnail on the right there was no longer any confusion which level was selected, as they were quickly distinguishable.

Furthermore I implemented a team selection scene for the selected level.

Throughout my internship at Virtual Play, I also participated in the Dutch Game Garden's [Network Lunches](https://www.dutchgamegarden.nl/project/network-lunch/). The network lunches attracted creative professionals, teachers, project leaders, future interns, and potential clients. During all the network lunches we played Soccer Nations: Battle together with or against other attendees, wrote down bugs, spectated others playing and asked for general feedback which we then further discussed and implemented.
