During my third year I was lucky enough to join [Virtual Play](https://virtualplay.games/)  in Utrecht as an intern. My main task was to fix bugs and add small additional features on their game Soccer Nations: Battle. I also worked on the input system of Soccer Nations: Battle, [Rewired](https://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/). Rewired replaces Unity’s input system with a new system that completely redefines how you work with input, with features like menu ownership and handling reconnecting/disconnecting controllers.


Furthermore I worked on implement a new localsiation system, as the initial localization system had its flaws, so we decided to use the [I2 Localization plugin](http://inter-illusion.com/tools/i2-localization/) from the Unity Asset store. I2 Localization provided an easy to use synchronization between an excel sheet (which we located at our Google Drive) for each language strings and keys.

Aside of programming I also worked on some UI/UX improvements.
In the new version (left) there are now multiple options available on the left side of the screen, which the player can navigate with their left  stick. On the right there is now a right thumbnail of the level, which the player can navigate with their right stick to select the level they would like to play.


<div class="container" style="padding: 0px">
  <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <div class="col-sm">

    <div class="col-sm">

    </div>
  </div>

The new stage selection should give the player a bit more freedom on how he would like to play his game. With the thumbnail there is no longer confusion which level is which and other levels are quickly distinguishable. Next to user experience I also created scalable scripts which should allow additional options to be done quite quickly.



Every first Wednesday of the month, there was a [Network Lunch](https://www.dutchgamegarden.nl/project/network-lunch/) located at the 5th floor of the Beatrix Building. The network lunch attracted creative professionals, teachers, project leaders, future interns, and potential clients. During all the network lunches we attended, we promoted and playtested Soccer Nations: Battle.

As a side activity Virtual Play were asked to demonstrate their game [Alpha Mind](https://virtualplay.games/portfolio/alpha-mind-nl/) at Rijkswaterstaat in Utrecht. Alpha Mind is a VR game that you fully control with your brain. The goal of the game is to remain in a desired state of mindfulness. Initially, the game helps you with this, but as you progress the challenge grows! A player who keeps their brain under control, can control nature and the elements with the power of their mind. During those two days we had to guide, aid and inform people about Alpha Mind and mindfulness. Anyone who wanted to try out the demo had to wear a VR headset, a Muse headband and wear headphones so they wouldn’t be distracted by their surroundings.
