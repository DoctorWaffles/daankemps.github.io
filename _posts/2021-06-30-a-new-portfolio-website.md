![From WordPress to Jekyll](https://i.imgur.com/8hf3hVV.png)
You smell that? The sacred smell of a new website. Now this badass of a website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

My previous website ran on WordPress and was extremely outdated, slow and not mobile-friendly whatsoever. 
It did not help that I also ran a quite bare minimum web hosting package and several plugins installed. But even then it is like trying to optimize the speed of a tortoise with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) requiring the entire LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP)

Now that my website runs Jekyll, it results in a tiny amount of load time. Also running on [Cloudflare's CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/), the website is nearing that close Google LightHouse 100 score.
Another nice thing about Jekyll is that it can run on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), with that I can easily restore changes and/or update something I want to without any hassle.

Running [portfolYOU](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU), a theme by Youssef Raafat, as a base with slight customization here and there it gives me quite fine control on things I want to have different.
