You smell that? The sacred smell of a new website. Now my badass portfolio website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

Previously I ran my website on WordPress and it was extremely outdated, slow and not mobile-friendly whatsoever. 
It did not help that I also ran a quite bare minimum web hosting package and several plugins installed. But even then it is like trying to optimize the 
speed of a tortoise with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) requiring the entire LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP).

Luckily now that my website runs Jekyll, it results in a tiny amount of load time due to its static files. Also running on [Cloudflare's CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/), 
the website is nearing that close perfect score of a hundred on both mobile and desktop on Google Lighthouse.
An extra is that Jekyll can be ran on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so now I can easily restore changes and/or update 
something I want to without any hassle with any bloated backends. And lets not forget that Github Pages is entirely free, so this will also saves me from having a monthly subscription for a webhost; a win-win situation.

As for design, Jekyll provides plenty of options. Running [portfolYOU](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU), a theme by Youssef Raafat,
as a base. Luckily portfolYOU comes with loads of easily adjustments in its configuration, but even outside of the configuration there is plenty to adjust by just overriding the theme.
